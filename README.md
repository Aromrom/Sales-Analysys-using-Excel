# 📊 Sales Data Analysis in Excel

Welcome to my **Sales Dataset Analysis** project!  
This project demonstrates how I use **Microsoft Excel** to analyze and summarize business data effectively. The dataset includes fields such as product names, sales regions, sales reps, transaction dates, and revenue figures. 🧾

## 🔧 Skills Demonstrated

### 🧮 1. Cell Referencing
- ✅ Applied **relative, absolute, and mixed cell references** to build dynamic and reusable formulas.
- 🎯 Used `$` symbols to lock rows or columns where needed.
